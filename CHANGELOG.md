    - [Beta feedback thread](https://github.com/cyanfish/naps2/discussions/35)
- Added Mac support
    - Supports macOS 10.15 and later
    - The Universal download should work for all users. Or you can use the Intel/Apple Silicon downloads for a smaller download/install size if you know which one your Mac has.
    - NAPS2 on Mac bundles SANE drivers for USB scanners, allowing supported scanners to be used even on new M1/M2 Macs (which normally wouldn't work without manufacturer-provided drivers)
- Added native Linux support
    - Requires Flatpak for installation (https://flatpak.org/setup/)
    - Mono is no longer required
    - The UI should now feel like a native Linux app
    - Much better performance and reliability
- TWAIN support has been reworked
    - Some lifecycle-related issues should hopefully be fixed (e.g. only being able to scan once)
    - With "Use predefined settings", TWAIN now uses the built-in NAPS2 progress window, which allows multitasking
    - TWAIN UI should no longer be visible in console and batch mode
    - TWAIN should also now support scanning larger images (e.g. 1200dpi) without out-of-memory issues
- Upgraded Tesseract to 5.2.0 for OCR
    - Up to 30% faster OCR performance
    - Tesseract is now bundled with the NAPS2 download, so no extra download is required (though you still need to download language data if you don't already have it).
- PDF import and export have been rewritten to leverage Pdfium
    - This means better support for importing different kinds of PDFs
    - In some cases this means much faster import/export
    - Pdfium is bundled with the NAPS2 download so there is no longer an extra download needed to import non-NAPS2 PDFs
- New Crop UI
